I always wanted to do awesome things in life. I participated in everything I could, I would take up new classes, I would ice skate, swim, dance, play volleyball, pingpong, learn to play a guitar. But I've never had the feeling, you know? 
THE feeling.
The feeling you get, when you know that a thing you do is THE thing you want to do for the rest of your life. 
And I would be miserable for a long period of time. I would think I'm not good enough in anything, I was always "kinda not horrible" in everything. Jack of all trades, master of none, right?
But then I thought. 
It doesn't matter.
Why would you focus on doing one thing for the rest of your life? Why would you want to cage yourself? Why not to be quite ok in everything you start? There was this awesome thread on tumblr I would quote but I can't google it.
Anyway, here's a dream I had recently:
I went to my teacher to give him a project that he assigned me as an additional personal project. He was very sure I can do it so I was stressed out I'm not gonna live up to the expectations. So I sat there with him and was supposed to run it right? And I wanted to like click on the python file. But my laptop was lagging so hard it could be having a heart attack if it was human. So I had to open it through the terminal. And the teacher said 'now we'll see if the girl can compile, haha'. I replied 'of course I can!'. And typed 'g plus plus my_teachers_nickname.py'
I. TYPED. G-FREAKING-PLUS-PLUS. ON. A. PYTHON. FILE.
It was there only for a second, but I saw the dissapointment in his eyes.
I woke up drenched in cold sweat. 
Yeah.

PS That exercise took me way too much time, java you lovely piece of crap.
